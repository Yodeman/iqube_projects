### Implementing Mergesort Algorithm

An algorithm that performs sorting with a time complexity of O(nlogn).

This implementation is an inplace recursive approach .i.e. it doesn't require another array for its output, and to ensure that my implementation works, I compared the output of my result to the output of python built-in sorted function.
