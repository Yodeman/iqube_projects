### HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL(HMM)

The hidden markov model is a model that uses some observed event to infer the likelihood of an event occurring e.g. a robot in a building that predicts the weather condition based on whether people coming into the building are with umbrella or not. HMMs can be used to generate sequences of observables, but their main application is for analyzing observes sequence. Its forward algorithm can be used to compute the likelihood of the given observed sequence and the Virterbi algorithm is used to predict a corresponding hidden sequence.

### CMU Sphinx

A a toolkit with the capability of converting human sound signals into words or instructions. Sphinx has been used in fields like telephony, desktop assistance etc. It is also used for other languages aside English for instance Arabisc a speech recognizer for Arabic language.

**Myserviceagent** can be improved into giving IoT devices instructions over phone calls by incorporating speech recognition engine that easily translate sound to text into **myserviceagent** architecture.



**CNN for speech recognition**

in CNN for speech recognition, audio signals are converted into spectrogram images which are then fed into the neural network to detects pattern in how words are pronounced.
