### Database Management System

For this task, I used the XAMP server to host my database.

Below is the image of initial database before creating the iqube_learn data base

My practice on SQL commandas can be seen in the [notebook](https://github.com/Yodeman/iqube_projects/blob/main/week2/DBMS/iqube_sql.ipynb)

**DROP** command is used to delete table(s) from a database

**JOIN** command is used to execute complex commands

**ALTER** command is used to set a table in a database for modification.
