### **LINUX OS AND LINUX COMMANDS**

I will not be able to install Linux OS on my laptop due to the kind of laptop I am using and I as well have space issue (my hard disk drive is almost full, i.e I wonâ€™t be able to partition it), but I am quite familiar with Linux environment on virtual machines from platform like Microsoft azure and google cloud platform. For this task, I practiced the Linux command using Cygwin and Git Bash command line interface.

 

Some of the commands I learnt are:

\1.   man <command> command which is used to check the documentation of what a command does. <command> --help does similar thing.

\2.   touch command can be used to create files.

\3.   ls command which is used to list the contents of a directory.

\4.   mkdir command which is used to create a new directory.

\5.   rmdir command which can be used to delete a directory.

\6.   gzip command which is used to compress files.

\7.   cat command which is used to view the content of a file. It can be used to concatenate files into another single file.

\8.   nano command which is used to open a file for editing.

\9.   gunzip command is like gzip command but default to decompressing .gz files.

\10. cd command which is used to change directory.

\11. find command which is used to search for files for folders.

\12. tar command which is used to group multiple files into a folder thereby creating a .tar file containing all the grouped files.

\13. grep command which is used to search to tokens in a file.

\14. sort command which can be used to arrange content of a file. It can as well be used to arrange the output of other commands.

\15. wc command which shows a little concise imformation about a file. It shows the number of words in the file, the number of lines and the size of the file.

\16. cp command which is used to to copy files to another location. Files in a directory can be copied recursively as well.

\17. mv command which is used to move a file/folder from one directory to another directory.

\18. diff command which when executed shows the difference between files. Directories can as well be compared for differences using this command.

\19. du command which is used to calculate the size of directory.

\20. df command which is used to show the disk usage.

\21. ps command which is used to list the processes running in the current user session.

\22. kill command, although its main purpose is to terminate processes but it can as well be used for other things .e.g kill --CONT PID which is used to continue as stopped process.

\23. which command which provides the path to an excutable.

\24. nohup command is used to tell to process to not stop even if there is an issue with network connection between say my computer or a virtual machine.

I was unable to practice commands like sudo, top e.t.c due to the application I am using but I quite understand what they are used for.
